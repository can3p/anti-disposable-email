# Anti Disposable Email Address Checker for Go

If you want to detect if new account registrations are using disposable email services, then this is your package.

**Ultimately this is a business decision.**

## Installation


```
go get -u github.com/can3p/anti-disposable-email
```

```go
import "github.com/can3p/anti-disposable-email"
```


## Usage

```go
import "github.com/can3p/anti-disposable-email"

ParsedEmail, _ := disposable.ParseEmail("rocketlaunchr.cloud@gmail.com")
````

### Output

```groovy
(disposable.ParsedEmail) {
 Email: (string) (len=21) "rocketlaunchr.cloud@gmail.com",
 Preferred: (string) (len=9) "rocketlaunchr.cloud",
 Normalized: (string) (len=9) "rocketlaunchrcloud",
 Extra: (string) "",
 Disposable: (bool) false,
 Domain: (string) (len=11) "gmail.com",
 LocalPart: (string) (len=9) "rocketlaunchr.cloud"
}

```

If `Disposable` is **true**, then the email address is from a disposable email service.

### Normalized

If you want to block duplicate email addresses from your database, then store as a unique-key the `Normalized` data. See [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rocketlaunchr/anti-disposable-email#ParsedEmail).

### Update

To get the latest list run the following script and commit

```bash
go run scripts/update.go
```
